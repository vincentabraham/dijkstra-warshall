# dijkstra-warshall
Estimating the Shortest Path using Dijkstra's &amp; Floyd Warshall Algorithm
- Done as a part of the 2CSOE52 - Data Structures course at Nirma University, Ahmedabad, India.
- For the abstract road network, Dijkstra's algorithm is used to estimate the path with the shortest time and Floyd Warshall algorithm is used to determine the path with the shortest distance.
- shortest_path.c consists of C code and Report.pdf provides documentation for the project.
